This guide serves as the first base in the world of FPGA Hardware acceleration (Xilinx Boards). I try to put resources I found useful in a comprehensive and cohesive manner.
 The guide includes a link to a youtube list (about 1H time) where I design an AXI-Stream Adder. Files generated from Vivado tool along with the Software code to run the adder are included in the repository
 inside "AXI-Adder Tutorial" folder.

Note: I used PYNQ-Z2 Board but the concept is valid for all Xilinx Boards, only difference would be in the Software code.
