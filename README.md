**Introduction:**

 This guide serves as the first base in the world of FPGA Hardware acceleration (Xilinx Boards).I try to put resources I found useful in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. More over, I try to mention every error I encountered as a beginner an how to avoid it.

Repository Contents: 
- FPGA Acceleration Rampup.pdf:  Teaches how to setup PYNQ-Z2 Board, then provides resources and notes in a structured manner that builds the needed concepts. 
- AXI_Adder_Tutorial: this folder includes all the files needed to recreate the demonstration project I created in the following playlist:

Note: I used PYNQ-Z2 Board but the concept is valid for all Xilinx Boards, only difference would be in the Software code.
